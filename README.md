# Sierpinski Triangle Drawing App

I was watching an [MIT lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqmUuHnvJ98) where the speaker referred to a simple algorithm for generating a [Sierpinski Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle).  The algorithm was so simple that I was surprised that it would really generate this famous fractal.  So I wrote this quick-and-dirty Windows Forms application to test out the algorithm.

The algorithm is described in the lecture video and in the [Sierpinski Triangle wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle) (under the "Chaos Game" construction).
